Most people use AI like a glorified search engine: type query ‚Üí extract answer ‚Üí close tab. 

But that's like using a brilliant consultant as a basic research assistant.

Here's how to transform AI from a servant into your thinking partner (and 10x your outputs): üßµ

I used to craft "perfect prompts" and get disappointed with responses. Sound familiar?

Everything changed when I stopped trying to EXTRACT from AI and started THINKING with it.

The difference? One mindset limits you. The other unlocks possibilities we're just exploring.

My lightbulb moment came while building an AI prompt generator app.

Instead of asking AI to "write a PRD for my app," I started a conversation:

"Here's my initial thinking... What critical questions should I be considering that I haven't addressed yet?"

What followed wasn't a template extraction.

It was a back-and-forth that exposed blind spots in my planning I never would have caught alone.

The final PRD emerged from our COLLABORATIVE thinking process. Much better than anything I could have created alone.

Every AI interaction is a choice:

‚ùå Extraction mindset: "What can AI do for me?"
‚úÖ Partnership mindset: "How can AI and I think better together?"

That second question changes everything.

Here are 5 partnership techniques that will transform your AI usage:

Technique #1: Add context by giving the full picture

‚ùå "Write me a cold email to a potential client"
‚úÖ "I run a web design studio for gym fashion. Reaching out to Gym Park with a dated Wix site..."

Specific context = tailored solutions, not generic outputs.

Technique #2: Start with a draft and improve it together

Don't ask AI to create from scratch - you're gambling on whether it understands what you want.

Instead: Share your rough draft, then collaborate to refine and strengthen it through iterations.

Technique #3: Let AI expose your blind spots

Before diving into any project, ask:
‚Ä¢ What 3 critical questions should I be asking?
‚Ä¢ What information am I likely missing?
‚Ä¢ What considerations should I keep in mind?

Surface expert-level questions BEFORE you start.

Technique #4: Stress-test your thinking

Use AI to deliberately challenge your ideas:
‚Ä¢ Find the 3 weakest parts of my reasoning
‚Ä¢ Play devil's advocate with my assertions  
‚Ä¢ Identify potential failure modes

Better to find flaws in a safe space than with stakeholders.

Technique #5: See it through different eyes

Ask AI to examine your ideas from multiple perspectives:
‚Ä¢ How would [different stakeholder] view this?
‚Ä¢ What would someone from [different discipline] focus on?

Reveals blind spots and generates insights you'd never consider alone.

Start small with these 4 shifts:

1. Always begin with context (30 seconds = massive dividends)
2. Never accept first output (best results are conversations away)  
3. Share your thinking first (do your homework!)
4. Ask "What am I missing?" as standard practice

In a world where everyone has the same AI tools, your advantage isn't magical prompts.

It's developing partnership thinking that transforms AI from a commodity tool into a personal cognitive extension.

What breakthrough have you had thinking WITH AI instead of just using it?
