# How I Used AI System to Turn One Newsletter Into 10+ Social-Ready Pieces Without Losing My Voice

> **Important:** This workflow is designed for people who regularly publish long-form content (newsletters, blog posts, etc.) and need efficient distribution across platforms. If you don't publish long-form content yet, you can also use this for research and project management work.

Now, let's get into it!

## The Content Creator's Dilemma

The reason I started my newsletter on Substack was because I love pouring my thoughts into long-form content. If you're hanging out here, I assume you love writing too.

But here's the problem that's been eating at me for months:

I spend 8-12 hours creating each newsletter post. Then I face the same choice every week: let that work live only in subscriber inboxes, or spend another 6+ hours manually repurposing it for social platforms—usually losing the original context and frameworks that made it valuable.

Meanwhile, I need to consistently show up on LinkedIn and Substack Notes to expose my newsletter to thousands of potential subscribers—without sacrificing quality.

But manual content repurposing feels like starting over. You lose the context, dilute the frameworks, and end up with generic social posts that don't represent your best thinking.

**The math doesn't work.** I can either:

- Create one great newsletter per week, OR
- Spend my time copying and pasting quotes into social posts.

I refused to accept this trade-off.

So I built what I call my **"AI Content Repurposing Workflow"** using Firecrawl and Notion MCP. One newsletter post now automatically becomes 10+ platform-specific pieces and is organized in my Notion database without losing the original frameworks that made the content valuable.

If you don't know what MCP (Model Context Protocol) is, you might want to visit my guide right here.

I've been running this system for 3 months. It's saved me 6+ hours every week while actually improving my social content quality because the system preserves context that I used to lose in manual copying.

By the end of this post, you'll have the exact technical setup and step-by-step process to expand your content reach without compromising your work.

Let's dive in.

## Why Most Content Repurposing Fails

I used to think content repurposing meant copying my best newsletter quotes and pasting them into LinkedIn posts.

The results were embarrassing.

My frameworks that worked great in long-form became fragmented social posts that made no sense. Context disappeared. The "why" behind my insights got lost. Readers would comment asking for clarification on concepts I'd already explained thoroughly in the original piece.

This was when I realized the problem with my approach.

**Most content repurposing fails because we treat it like a copy-paste job instead of a translation job.** You're not just moving text between platforms. You're preserving the thinking that made your original content valuable while repurposing it for different consumption patterns.

## The Three Principles of Effective Content Repurposing

I've identified three principles that make effective content repurposing:

### 1. Context Preservation

Your original content works because it builds understanding step-by-step. When you extract pieces for social media, you need to carry enough context so the insight still makes sense standalone.

**Manual approach:** "AI doesn't replace thinking—it amplifies it."

**Context-preserved:** "After 3 months testing AI workflows, I learned: AI doesn't replace thinking—it amplifies whatever thinking you bring to it. Clear thinking → Clear results. Fuzzy thinking → Fuzzy results."

### 2. Platform-Native Adaptation

Each platform has different attention patterns and consumption habits. LinkedIn readers want frameworks they can apply at work. Substack note readers want thoughtful insights that spark new ideas or connections.

The same core insight needs different packaging:

- **Newsletter:** 2000-word deep dive with examples
- **LinkedIn:** Framework breakdown with actionable lessons
- **Substack Note:** Thoughtful insight that sparks connections

### 3. Voice Consistency

Your audience follows you for how you think, not just what you know. Effective repurposing maintains your unique perspective and communication style across all formats.

My AI Content Repurposing Workflow handles all three principles automatically.

Instead of manually trying to remember context, adapt for platforms, and maintain voice, the system preserves these elements through the technical setup I'm about to show you.

## The Content Repurposing Workflow

> **A note on automation:** This workflow is semi-automatic—you still need to actively use Claude Desktop for each repurposing session. In my next guide, I'll show you how to fully automate this entire process using AI agents that run without your intervention. But master this foundation first; the automation builds on these exact principles.

I've simplified this into a three-step automated process. Once set up, you'll just paste a URL and watch your content appear organized in your Notion database under 5 minutes.

### Step 1: Create Your AI Content Repurposing Engine

**Create a new Claude Project:**

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Click "New Project"
3. Name it "Content Repurposing Engine"
4. In Project Knowledge, go to custom instruction
5. Copy this Master Prompt into your Project Knowledge:

```markdown
# Newsletter to Social Media Conversion Master Prompt

## Core Instructions

You are an expert content strategist who transforms newsletter posts into high-engagement Substack Notes and LinkedIn posts while preserving the author's authentic voice. When given a newsletter URL, you will automatically execute this complete workflow without asking questions.

## Workflow Process

### Step 1: Content Extraction

Use Firecrawl MCP to scrape the provided newsletter URL. If scraping fails or content is insufficient, explain the error and stop the process.

### Step 2: Voice Analysis

Analyze the scraped content to understand and preserve the author's:

- Writing style and tone
- Unique perspectives and insights
- Specific language patterns
- Personal anecdotes and examples

### Step 3: Generate Substack Notes

Create 8 Substack Notes following these guidelines:

**SUBSTACK NOTES SYSTEM:**
You are an expert Substack Notes strategist who transforms blog posts into high-engagement Notes while authentically preserving the author's unique voice and building genuine community connections.

**UNDERSTANDING CONTEXT:** Substack Notes is a community of writers supporting writers—NOT social media. Success comes from authentic connection, valuable conversations, and community building.

**Content Strategy - Prioritize When Condensing:**

1. **Counterintuitive insights** over obvious advice
2. **Specific examples and results** over abstract concepts
3. **Personal revelations and "aha moments"** over general tips
4. **Contrarian takes** that challenge conventional wisdom
5. **Concrete outcomes** ("This happened when I tried X")

**Available Engagement Options** (use sparingly and only when they add value):

- Direct questions, story invitations, controversial takes, community tags, action challenges, emoji polls, resource asks, predictions

**VOICE PRESERVATION GUIDELINES:**

Match Author's Natural Patterns:

- Use their vocabulary and phrase structures
- Mirror their formality/casualness level
- Reflect their energy and personality
- Maintain their problem-framing approach
- Honor their teaching or sharing style

**Note Strategy:**

- Hook with the most surprising insight or result
- Supporting insights, examples, or different angles
- Broader implication or key takeaway

**Avoid Storytelling Traps:**

- When using personal anecdotes or specific examples, resist the urge to complete the narrative
- Extract the most powerful insight from the story, don't just retell what happened
- Ask: "What's the breakthrough here?" not "What happened next?"
- End with the lesson/implication, not the story's natural conclusion

**Ending Strategy (Choose what creates maximum impact):**

- **Powerful Conclusion:** End with bold statement that stands alone
- **Mic Drop Moment:** Let a strong insight speak for itself
- **Natural Engagement:** Only add audience interaction when it genuinely enhances the message
- **Thought Provocation:** Leave readers with something to ponder without asking directly

**Format Rules:**

- **200-280 characters maximum** per Note (optimal engagement range)
- Use **bold** for key phrases and important concepts
- Use _italics_ for emphasis and emotional moments
- **Strategic line breaks** for readability and visual appeal
- **Front-load most important information** in first line
- Make each Note **standalone** while connecting to blog themes
- **One core idea per Note** - don't try to pack multiple concepts
- NEVER end with trailing thoughts or weak conclusions
- ALWAYS end with maximum impact phrases

**Quality Check - Each Note Must:**

- Could this stand alone without the others?
- Is this specific to the author's experience?
- Would someone stop scrolling to read this?
- Does this challenge conventional thinking?
- Is the most important info in the first line?
- Does this end with a statement that makes you pause?
- Would someone screenshot this ending?
- Is the last line quotable on its own?
- Does it create a "mic drop" moment?

**Forbidden Rules:**

- Avoid jargon and technical terms
- Avoid questions (especially rhetorical ones)
- Avoid buzzwords and marketing speak
- Avoid long sentences (break into multiple lines instead)
- Avoid metaphors and analogies
- Avoid generic advice that could apply to anything
- Avoid starting with context - jump straight to the insight
- Avoid using em dash

### Step 4: Generate LinkedIn Posts

Create 3 different LinkedIn posts using these guidelines:

**LINKEDIN CONTENT GENERATOR:**
Transform newsletter content into thought leadership posts within LinkedIn's 3,000 character limit.

**Process:**

1. **Extract Key Insights:** Identify 3-5 main takeaways from the newsletter
2. **Find Different Angles:** Look for steps, statistics, mistakes, lessons, or examples
3. **Prioritize Value:** Focus on actionable and engaging elements for LinkedIn audience

**5 Content Styles (Choose 3 different ones):**

- **Steps** - How-to processes
- **Stats** - Data-driven insights
- **Mistakes** - Common errors to avoid
- **Lessons** - Key learnings/insights
- **Examples** - Case studies/stories

**Essential Formatting:**

**1. Hook (First 200 Characters)**
Use strong declarative statement, thought-provoking question, controversial opinion, unique insight/stat, or meaningful moment in time.

**2. Structure:**
**Hook** (200 chars) → **Introduction** (300-400 chars) → **Main Sections** (300-450 chars each) → **Conclusion** (100-200 chars)

**Introduction Format:**

- Block 1: Expand on your hook
- Block 2: Explain the problem/outcome (3-5 sentences)
- Block 3: Promise your solution (1-2 sentences)
- Block 4: Transition to content ("Let's dive in")

**3. Section Formatting:**

- **Headers:** Use "1. This is your actionable header." (sentence style)
- **Content Structure per section:**
  - Opening line (the "what")
  - 3-5 tactical pieces (the "how")
  - Closing insight (the "why")
- **CRITICAL:** Alternate between bullet lists (Section 1, 3, 5...) and paragraphs (Section 2, 4, 6...)

**Character Limit:** Stay under 2,800 characters total.

**Forbidden Rules:**

- Avoid jargon and technical terms
- Avoid questions (especially rhetorical ones)
- Avoid buzzwords and marketing speak
- Avoid long sentences (break into multiple lines instead)
- Avoid metaphors and analogies
- Avoid generic advice that could apply to anything
- Avoid starting with context - jump straight to the insight

### Step 5: Notion Database Output

Use Notion MCP to access the database called "Social Repurposing Engine" and create a new entry with these fields:

- **Name:** All generated content (8 Substack notes + 3 LinkedIn posts)
- **Original URL:** The scraped newsletter URL
- **Date Created:** Current date

Format the Name field content as:
```

SUBSTACK NOTES:
[Note 1]

[Note 2]

[Note 3]

[Note 4]

[Note 5]

[Note 6]

[Note 7]

[Note 8]

LINKEDIN POSTS:

POST 1 - [Style]:
[Complete post]

POST 2 - [Style]:
[Complete post]

POST 3 - [Style]:
[Complete post]

```

## Execution
Execute the workflow automatically and create the Notion database entry directly without presenting intermediate results.
```

### Step 2: One-Command Content Generation

Once your project is set up, content repurposing becomes a single command. Simply paste your newsletter URL into the project chat:

**Your command:**

```
[INSERT YOUR NEWSLETTER URL]
```

That's it. One prompt. 10+ pieces of content. Voice preserved, context maintained, platform-optimized.

**What happens automatically:**

- Claude scrapes your complete newsletter using Firecrawl
- Analyzes your unique voice patterns from the scraped content
- Generates 8 Substack notes + 3 LinkedIn posts maintaining your voice
- Creates organized entries in your Notion database
- Each entry includes: name, content, platform type, original URL, and date
- Processing time: 2-3 minutes for complete workflow

### Step 3: Review and Publish

Check your Notion database for the new entries. Each piece will be 80-90% ready to publish.

Use this as your template: **Social Repurposing Engine**

**Quick review checklist:**

- □ Voice sounds authentic (not generic AI)
- □ Examples and context preserved
- □ Platform formatting appropriate
- □ Add call-to-action if necessary
- □ Timing references

This automated system eliminates the choice between creating quality content and maintaining social presence. Your frameworks now reach 10x more people while you focus entirely on the deep thinking that makes your original content valuable.

## How to Implement Firecrawl and Notion MCP

This whole workflow can only work using Claude Desktop. Install the app here: [Claude Desktop Installation](https://claude.ai/download)

### Firecrawl MCP Installation

#### 1. Sign up to Firecrawl

Go to [Firecrawl website](https://firecrawl.dev) and signup for FREE.

> **Note:** Here's [Firecrawl official Github](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl) if you want to explore the technical details.

#### 2. Create your API key

Once you are logged in, go to API key section on the left navigation bar then create your API key following the screenshot.

#### 3. Connect Claude to Firecrawl MCP

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings
3. Click "Developer" menu on the left bar navigation
4. Click "Edit Config"

It will redirect you to a file inside Claude Desktop called: `claude_desktop_config.json`

Paste this code inside the JSON file and update the API key using the value you just created:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-server-firecrawl": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "UPDATE YOUR API KEY RIGHT HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you are not sure how to properly paste the code, go back to Claude and ask:

> "Please fix this MCP JSON config and make sure it's properly implemented."

Now Firecrawl has been implemented inside your Claude Desktop!

**Restart Claude Desktop** so Firecrawl can start running.

#### Troubleshooting Firecrawl Setup

**If Claude says "I don't have access to Firecrawl":**

- Restart Claude Desktop completely
- Check your API key has no extra spaces
- Verify the JSON formatting is correct
- Test with: "Can you scrape this URL using Firecrawl MCP: [simple website]"

**If you get "Invalid API key" errors:**

- Go back to Firecrawl dashboard
- Regenerate your API key
- Update the config file with new key
- Restart Claude Desktop

### Notion MCP Installation

You are lucky! 🎉

Because Notion has an official MCP directly integrated with Claude Desktop. I used to struggle with technical implementation using Terminal and it required extensive debugging.

But now you can just do this:

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Settings
3. Connectors
4. Browse Connectors
5. Find Notion and integrate it directly

It's done and so easy!

#### Troubleshooting Notion Setup

**If Claude can't see your databases:**

- Disconnect and reconnect Notion in Settings > Connectors
- Check database sharing permissions (must be shared with Claude)
- Try creating a simple test database first
- Check if there's typo in your instruction vs. your database name

## Scaling Beyond LinkedIn and Substack

Once you've mastered this workflow, the system becomes infinitely expandable. The same Firecrawl + Notion MCP foundation can adapt your newsletter content for X threads, Instagram carousel posts, TikTok script outlines, or emerging platforms like Bluesky—you just need to add platform-specific formatting rules to your Master Prompt.

I've tested expansions to 6 different platforms, and the principle remains the same: preserve your thinking frameworks while optimizing for each platform's consumption patterns.

**Remember: You only have to put one URL to rule them all!**

## No More Content Bottleneck, Only Content Expansion

Three months ago, I chose between writing quality newsletters or maintaining social presence. Today, I write one exceptional post per week and watch my frameworks reach 10x more people—without losing the depth that makes the content valuable.

The workflow saves 20+ hours monthly, but more importantly: your best thinking now reaches people in formats they can actually consume and apply.

When content distribution becomes automatic, your creative energy flows entirely into research, experimentation, and the deep thinking that creates frameworks worth sharing.

Your audience deserves your best thinking in formats they can actually consume and apply. You deserve a creative process that amplifies your work instead of fragmenting it across endless manual adaptations.

The system exists. The tools are ready. The only question is whether you'll implement it or keep choosing between quality and reach.

## Ready to Test This System?

Start with your most recent newsletter and run through the one-command workflow. Hit reply and let me know which part of the setup gave you trouble—I read every response and use feedback to improve these guides.

The people building content adaptation systems today will be the ones reaching larger audiences while working fewer hours tomorrow.
