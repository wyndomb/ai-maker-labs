# What I've Actually Been Building While Writing About AI

**I'm opening my AI Lab to fellow experimenters like you.**

_By Wyndo | July 30, 2025_

**I need to share something that's been eating at me.**

For months, I've been experimenting with AI workflows that honestly feel like magic. Not the "wow, ChatGPT wrote my email" kind of magic. I'm talking about AI systems that fundamentally change how I think, work, and solve problems.

But every time I sit down to write the newsletter, I find myself stuck:

- How do I explain Model Context Protocol integration in a way that doesn't sound like technical gibberish?
- How do I show you the raw Cursor workflows I use for non-coding projects without turning this into a 5,000-word manual?
- How do I build apps that automate some of my tasks and save me 20+ hours per week?

So I've been giving you the highlights while preparing all the wild stuff in my personal lab.

**That changes today.**

## What I've Actually Been Building

While writing about AI frameworks, I've been quietly experimenting with advanced tools and workflows that can take your AI journey further:

- **MCP integrations** that let Claude directly manipulate my Notion databases, Gmail, Memory, and other tools in real-time during our conversations
- **AI agent** that research topics, analyze findings, and populate my knowledge base without me touching a single app
- **AI coding workflows** for building apps and automating tasks, even though I can't code
- **Advanced prompt architectures** that turn AI into genuine thinking partners for complex decisions

The problem? Sharing this stuff properly requires going 10x deeper than typical my newsletter posts.

And honestly? The growth has been wild. We've gone from zero to nearly 4,000 readers in four months, which means there's clearly demand for practical AI content. But I keep getting the sense that some of you want to see the really advanced stuffâ€”the experimental workflows I can't fit into a regular newsletter.

## Why I'm Launching Premium Access

**Here's the honest truth:** I'm launching premium because I'm bursting with excitement about what I've learned, and I want to share the real implementation details with people who geek out about this stuff as much as I do.

I just couldn't hide my excitement to show you what's possible when you push these tools to their limits.

### What will happen to free posts?

**Free AI Maker stays exactly the same:** Strategic frameworks and insights that help you think better about AI integration.

### But...

**Premium AI Maker will take you further. It's my lab notebook:** Raw experiments, step-by-step implementations, the failures that taught me something important, and the breakthroughs that actually changed how I work.

## What You Get Inside the Lab

### ðŸ”¬ My AI Workflow Experiments

Real workflows I'm testing, complete with setup guides, the prompts that actually work, and honest assessments of what's worth your time vs. what's just hype.

### ðŸš€ Advanced Tool Deep Dives

How to use tools like Claude's project knowledge, Cursor or Claude Code for project management and research, MCP for workflow automation, AI coding tools, and AI agents for researchâ€”with step-by-step walkthroughs of my actual use cases.

### ðŸ’¬ Fellow Experimenters

A focused community of people who get excited about pushing AI boundaries. Share what's working, troubleshoot what's broken, discover what's possible together.

### ðŸ”— Direct Access to Me

Reply to any premium post email and I'll help you adapt my experiments to your specific situation. You can also DM me directly!

## Why This Matters Right Now

We're in this incredible moment where the most powerful AI capabilities are still mostly unknown to the mainstream. While everyone's still figuring out basic ChatGPT prompts, there are tools and techniques that feel like having superpowers.

I want to share this stuff with people who are as excited about the possibilities as I am.

## The Investment: $10/month or $96/year (20% off)

**Here's how I thought about pricing:** $10/month ($8/month annually) for workflows that save me 20+ hours per week. That's $2/weekâ€”literally less than a single coffeeâ€”for AI implementations that would cost thousands and hours to develop yourself.

**For people who have pledged for AI Maker**, your current price will stay the same, nothing changes. Thanks for believing in me :)

## This Is for Fellow AI Experimenters

If you're happy with strategic frameworks and want to stay at that level, the free newsletter will continue giving you exactly that value. I love what I write and I want to keep it that way.

**Premium is for people who think:**

> "Show me what's really possible. I want to see the actual implementations, even if they're messy or experimental."

If you get excited about advanced tools and want to see how someone is actually pushing AI to its limits in real-world applications, then this is your jam.

## What Stays Free

Everything that makes the current newsletter valuable. Free content introduces concepts and strategic thinking. Premium opens up my actual laboratory.

Think of it like this:

- **Free:** "Here's why AI workflow automation matters for knowledge workers, entrepreneurs, and content creators."
- **Premium:** "Here's my exact MCP setup that lets Claude manage my entire project pipeline, including the JSON configs, troubleshooting guide, and why this approach beats typical automation"

Different purposes, both valuable.

## My Promise to You

Whether you join premium or stick with the free content, I'm committed to sharing what I learn about AI integration.

If you do join the lab:

- **Real experiments only** â€” no fluff content to hit publishing schedules
- **Honest assessments** â€” what works, what doesn't, and why
- **Direct support** when you want to adapt my experiments
- **A community** of people who actually implement this stuff

## Still Curious but Not Ready?

Totally get it. Stick with the free newsletter and watch how the premium experiments land with the community. If the deep dives and member implementations get you excited, you can always join later.

The only thing you'll miss is to be an early adopter that can put you in different position in the next 6-12 months. You'll be in the frontier of the new tech and AI workflow.

**I'm genuinely excited to share this stuff.**

Whether you join the lab or stay with free content, you're part of a community that's actually building with AI instead of just talking about it.

And honestly? That's what matters most.

**Best,**
Wyndo

**P.S.** If you're wondering whether premium is right for your situation, just reply. I read every email and I'm happy to help you think through it.
