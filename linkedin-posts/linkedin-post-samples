## Post 1: AI vs Google Search Shift

Google Search is losing the information war to AI - and most businesses are completely unprepared for what comes next.

Look at this data: While Google Search has been flat or declining since 2023, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini have been steadily climbing.

This represents a fundamental shift in how people find information.

**Why this is happening:**
‚Üí AI gives direct answers instead of 10 blue links
‚Üí No more clicking through SEO-optimized articles that don't actually help
‚Üí Personalized responses instead of generic search results
‚Üí Synthesis instead of just discovery

But here's what most people are missing: This change affects content strategy entirely.

**The old approach:** Create content ‚Üí Optimize for Google ‚Üí Hope people find you
**The emerging approach:** Create valuable content ‚Üí AI discovers and recommends you ‚Üí Build audience faster

Real example: My newsletter gets subscribers from ChatGPT and Perplexity searches now even though I didn't optimize for AI algorithms. But, I optimized on creating genuinely useful content that AI systems naturally recommend.

**What this means for your business:**
Instead of chasing Google keywords, focus on creating content that AI naturally wants to reference.

**Practical steps:**
‚Ä¢ Create content so valuable that AI systems naturally cite it
‚Ä¢ Build expertise and authenticity over ranking tricks
‚Ä¢ Develop authority in your domain rather than gaming algorithms
‚Ä¢ Ask "Will AI recommend this?" alongside "Will this help people?"

The companies that figure this out first will have a massive advantage.

While everyone else is still playing the old SEO game, you'll be building the relationships with AI systems that are becoming the primary way people discover expertise.

The question isn't whether AI will replace Google for information discovery.

The question is: Will your content be what AI recommends when people ask for help in your area?

Time to find out.

## Post 2: $10K ARR Newsletter Success

My 5-month old newsletter AI Maker just hit $10K ARR in less than two months after going paid on Substack.

Here are 6 lessons that surprised me about going paid:

For context: 5K+ subscribers, launched paid tier recently, and somehow earned a best-selling badge (still feels surreal).

These insights might help if you're considering monetizing your audience:

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Launch paid immediately, don't wait for "perfect" timing.**

Most creators overthink the launch. You need real data from paying subscribers to understand what content actually converts. The only way to get this data is to start charging and learn from subscriber behavior.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Your silent readers are often your best customers.**

Most of my paid subscribers rarely engage with public content, but they convert anyway. You have more people willing to pay than you realize - but you'll never discover them without offering a paid option.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ SEO remains your highest-converting channel**

Google drives my highest conversion rates to paid subscriptions. While everyone talks about AI search, I've been improving SEO on existing posts. Organic discovery still works exceptionally well for newsletter growth.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Build one flagship piece of paid content**

My Claude Project Knowledge Guide converts more paid subscribers than anything else. I treat it like a living document, updating monthly based on subscriber feedback. One exceptional piece of content can carry your entire paid strategy.

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Treat your homepage like a business landing page**

Optimize every touchpoint: "Why Upgrade" page, "Start Here" section, welcome emails, about page. My second-highest conversion source is the "Why Upgrade" page specifically. Present your newsletter as a serious business, not a hobby project.

**6Ô∏è‚É£ Define your specific value proposition**

My breakthrough: I help subscribers learn one automation workflow they can implement immediately to save time on work that matters. Clear, specific, measurable value. Simple messaging converts better than complex positioning.

What I've learned so far is going paid forced me to clarify what value I actually provide. Free content can be vague about outcomes. Paid content demands specific, measurable benefits.

Thanks to everyone who engages with my content and to all 100+ AI Maker Labs members for making this possible.

Excited to keep building this forward üî•

## Post 3: Prompts Reveal Your Worldview

Your prompts reveal more about you than your resume ever could.

When you write prompts, you're not just giving instructions. You're encoding a worldview, tone, and entire framework for how AI should think and respond.

It's like "cosplaying god but with patch notes."

This explains why most people struggle with AI.

They think prompting is about finding the right words to get what they want. But it's actually about defining an entire persona and way of thinking.

When I write prompts for my newsletter work, I'm not just saying "write about AI."

**I'm defining:**
‚Üí How to approach problems (experimentation over theory)
‚Üí What tone to use (conversational, not corporate)
‚Üí What to value (practical results over hype)
‚Üí How to think about the audience (knowledge workers, not techies)

**Here's the example:**
‚ùå Bad prompt: "Write a LinkedIn post about AI tools"
‚úÖ Good prompt: "You're a practical AI experimenter who tests tools before recommending them. Write like you're sharing a discovery with a colleague, not teaching a masterclass. Focus on what actually worked, not what sounds impressive."

Here's the truth nobody talks about: Your prompts reveal how you think about work, problems, and communication. AI becomes a mirror of your own mental models.

If you are being vague, then your AI will be garbage.
But if you are being precise, then your AI will generate 10x better output.

Instead of asking "How do I get AI to do this task?" I ask "What kind of thinking partner do I need for this challenge?"

The results are completely different.

Your prompts are blueprints for the kind of intelligence you want to work with.

What kind of AI partner are you actually building through your prompts?

## Post 4: Why Corporate AI Pilots Fail

This is exactly why 95% of corporate AI pilots fail.

**Here's how it typically starts:**
CEO hears AI buzz at conference ‚Üí CTO gets mandate ‚Üí CIO picks random tool ‚Üí Nobody knows how to use it ‚Üí "AI doesn't work"

No wonder AI pilot projects fail.

Instead of understanding the real problem in their work, companies jump instantly to integrate AI as their new project.

**Here's what actually works: Start small and specific.**

‚Üí Pick ONE workflow that's painful right now
‚Üí Find the person who's already frustrated with that process
‚Üí Let them experiment with AI tools for that specific problem
‚Üí Measure results, not usage

Example: Instead of "company-wide AI strategy," start with "help Sarah in accounting automate invoice processing" or "help the content team research faster."

**Then expand from what works:**
‚Ä¢ Document what worked and why
‚Ä¢ Find similar problems in other departments
‚Ä¢ Let early adopters become internal champions
‚Ä¢ Scale what's proven, kill what isn't

Look, AI adoption succeeds when it solves real problems. But it most likely fails if it's a top-down initiative searching for a use case or just following the hype.

The companies winning with AI aren't the ones with the biggest budgets or fanciest tools. They're the ones letting people experiment with solving actual problems.

Have you seen this corporate AI adoption cycle at your company? What actually worked vs. what was mandated from above?

## Post 5: The Best Prompts Come From Your Head

The best prompt isn't in someone's template library. It's in your head.

I see people sharing "ultimate prompt libraries" every day. Hundreds of templates for every possible use case.

I tried that approach for months. Bookmark this, save that, copy someone else's "perfect" prompt.

But the results were mediocre at best.

That's when I realized: stop looking for the "right" prompt and start building my own.

Not because I'm some prompt engineering genius, but because I realized something obvious: The best prompts come from knowing exactly what you want.

Most people fail at AI because they're fuzzy about their actual goal. They'll copy a template without understanding why it works or how to adapt it.

**Instead, I use this simple approach:**
"You are to act as my prompt engineer. I would like to accomplish: [insert your goal]. Please repeat this back to me in your own words, and ask any clarifying questions."

**Why this works:**
‚úÖ Forces me to articulate what I actually want
‚úÖ AI asks the questions I didn't think of
‚úÖ Creates a custom prompt based on MY specific needs
‚úÖ Teaches me better thinking through the process

**Example:** Instead of using someone's "content creation template," I tell AI I want to write about my coding mistake, and it asks:
‚Ä¢ What specific lesson do you want readers to take away?
‚Ä¢ Who is your target audience?
‚Ä¢ What tone fits your brand?
‚Ä¢ What outcome do you want from this post?

The result: A prompt that's 100% tailored to what I'm actually trying to accomplish.

Most people think prompt engineering is about memorizing templates. It's not!

It's about thinking clearly about your goals and communicating them effectively.

Stop collecting prompts. Start building your ability to think through problems.

Your brain is the best prompt template you'll ever have.

Anyone else notice better results when they stopped using other people's prompts?

## Post 6: Foundation-First Prompting

Most people get prompt engineering backwards.

They start hunting for the "perfect example prompt" instead of building proper foundations.

I see this everywhere: people copying magical prompt templates from Twitter/LinkedIn, searching for that one perfect example that will solve everything.

**Here's what actually happens:**
You find a "killer prompt" for writing emails. You copy it exactly. It works once, maybe twice. Then it starts producing generic garbage because you never understood WHY it worked.

You skipped the setup entirely.

**Most people think prompt engineering means:**
‚Üí Find good examples
‚Üí Copy successful templates
‚Üí Add more specific instructions
‚Üí Hope for better results

But that approach is completely backwards.

I learned something that changed everything: Anthropic's internal prompt engineering framework.

Their 10-step framework puts examples at step #5 - not first, not last, but right where they belong: AFTER you've established proper context.

**The right sequence:**
1. Task context - What you're actually trying to accomplish
2. Tone context - How it should sound and feel
3. Background data - Everything the AI needs to know about your situation
4. Detailed task description - Specific requirements and constraints
5. Examples - Now show what good looks like
6. Conversation history - Previous context if continuing a discussion
7. Immediate task - The specific request right now
8. Thinking process - How to approach the problem
9. Output formatting - How to structure the response
10. Prefilled response - Start the AI's thinking in the right direction

When you build this foundation first, even basic examples become powerful. When you skip straight to examples, even great ones fall flat.

**The difference:** Foundation-first prompting creates AI that understands your context and adapts. Example-first prompting creates AI that copies patterns without understanding.

Stop searching for magic prompts. Start building proper foundations.

What step do you usually skip when prompting AI?
