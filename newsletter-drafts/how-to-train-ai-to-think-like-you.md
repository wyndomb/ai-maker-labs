# How to Train AI to Think Like You (Not the Other Way Around)

**Moving beyond generic prompts to AI that reflects your specific cognitive patterns**

_Draft Outline - [Date TBD]_

## Hook & Personal Story (150-200 words)
- Open with moment of realization: "I caught myself changing how I think to match ChatGPT's responses"
- Describe the creeping influence: starting to structure thoughts in AI-friendly bullet points, losing personal voice in writing
- The wake-up call: "I was becoming more like the AI instead of making the AI more like me"

## The Problem Most People Don't See (300-400 words)
**Subtitle: "The Cognitive Colonization Problem"**

- Most AI training focuses on better prompts, not better alignment
- Common failure patterns:
  - Using generic "act as an expert" prompts
  - Accepting AI's default personality and thinking style
  - Gradually conforming to AI's preferred communication patterns
- The hidden cost: losing your unique cognitive advantages
- Quote from existing content: "You don't need to become a developer. You need to become a director."

## What "Training AI to Think Like You" Actually Means (200-300 words)
- Distinguish from fine-tuning (technical) vs. contextual training (practical)
- Core insight: AI should amplify your thinking patterns, not replace them
- Three levels of cognitive alignment:
  1. Surface level: tone and style
  2. Structural level: how you approach problems
  3. Deep level: your unique perspective and biases

## The 4-Layer Cognitive Training Framework (800-1000 words)

### Layer 1: Cognitive Fingerprinting
**"Teaching AI Your Mental Models"**
- Document how you naturally break down complex problems
- Capture your decision-making patterns and biases
- Example prompt template: "Here's how I typically approach [type of problem]. Notice that I always start with [X], then consider [Y]. When you help me with similar problems, mirror this approach."

### Layer 2: Perspective Injection
**"Programming Your Unique Worldview"**
- Upload examples of your best insights and why they're uniquely yours
- Include your contrarian takes and unpopular opinions
- System prompt: "You have access to my perspective on [topic]. When discussing this, reference my specific viewpoint rather than generic expert knowledge."

### Layer 3: Communication DNA
**"Matching Your Natural Voice"**
- Beyond tone - capturing your logical flow and argument structure
- How you use examples, analogies, and evidence
- Training AI to argue like you argue, not like a textbook

### Layer 4: Intellectual Habits
**"Replicating Your Thinking Patterns"**
- Your natural questioning style
- How you connect disparate ideas
- Your approach to uncertainty and partial information

## Real Implementation Examples (400-500 words)
- Specific prompts that worked for training Claude on your thinking style
- Before/after examples showing generic AI responses vs. "Wyndo-trained" responses
- Common mistakes and how to fix them
- Why this is different from just having a good prompt library

## The Meta-Skills This Develops (200-300 words)
- Forces you to become conscious of your own thinking patterns
- Improves your ability to articulate complex ideas
- Creates a feedback loop that actually makes you a better thinker
- The paradox: training AI makes you more uniquely human

## Your 30-Minute Start (200 words)
- Pick one domain where you have strong opinions
- Document your mental model in 3-5 bullet points
- Test it with a specific problem
- Iterate based on whether the AI response "sounds like you"
