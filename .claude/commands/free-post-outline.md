Help me create a free tier AI Maker newsletter post outline that establishes authority and demonstrates AI possibilities without giving away implementation details.

FORMAT:
- Personal hook/story that demonstrates the result
- The "why" behind the system/approach
- High-level framework or methodology  
- Results and benefits achieved
- Teaser of what's possible with proper implementation
- Call-to-action for paid tier implementation guide

Ask me what AI system, tool, or workflow result I want to showcase, then create the complete outline with suggested content for each section.
