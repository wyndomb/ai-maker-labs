Help me create 5 different compelling opening hooks for this AI Maker newsletter topic. Each hook should:

- Start with a personal story or realization
- Create curiosity about the transformation achieved
- Address a common pain point or misconception
- Set up the framework/system to be revealed
- Match The AI Maker's direct, conversational tone

Ask me for the main topic/framework, then provide 5 distinct hook options with brief explanations of why each would work well.
