Help me systematically document an AI workflow I've built so it can become newsletter content. We need to:

1. Map the complete process flow
2. Identify all tools and integrations involved  
3. Document exact prompts and configurations
4. Note optimization points and customizations
5. Identify common failure points and solutions
6. Determine free vs paid content split
7. Create step-by-step implementation guide

Ask me about the workflow I want to document, then guide me through creating comprehensive content that can be split between strategic overview (free) and implementation blueprint (paid).
