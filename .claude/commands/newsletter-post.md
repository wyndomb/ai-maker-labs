I need to write a new AI Maker newsletter post. Please help me structure it following these guidelines:

CONTEXT: The AI Maker newsletter focuses on practical AI implementation for everyday users, with three main learning paths:
1. AI Workflow Mastery (44%) - Building AI systems vs one-off tools
2. Tool Mastery (22%) - Deep tool implementation  
3. Thinking Mastery (33%) - AI-augmented cognitive frameworks

STRUCTURE:
- Hook with personal story/realization
- Identify common failure patterns
- Present systematic framework
- Include step-by-step implementation
- End with actionable next steps

VOICE: Direct, conversational, honest about failures, focus on transformation over efficiency

Please ask me:
1. What's the main topic/framework I want to cover?
2. What personal experience or story triggered this insight?
3. Which learning path does this align with?
4. Is this free tier (strategy/inspiration) or paid tier (implementation blueprint)?

Then help me create the full post structure with content suggestions.
