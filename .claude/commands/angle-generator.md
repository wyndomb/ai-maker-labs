Generate 5 different strategic angles for any newsletter draft to maximize engagement and conversion potential.

When the user runs this command with a draft filename, analyze the content and generate 5 distinct approaches, each optimized for different reader psychology and engagement patterns based on The AI Maker's proven content themes and conversion strategies.

## Usage

`/angle-generator [filename]`

## Process

1. Read the specified newsletter draft file
2. Analyze the core content, key insights, and potential value propositions
3. Generate 5 strategic angles using The AI Maker's content framework
4. Include engagement predictions and conversion potential for each angle

## The 5 Angle Framework

### 1. The Transformation Story Angle
Personal journey with measurable before/after results, vulnerability + breakthrough moment, focusing on emotional transformation vs. technical features.

### 2. The Contrarian Challenge Angle  
"Forget X: Here's what actually works" approach that challenges conventional AI wisdom and positions content as insider knowledge vs. mainstream advice.

### 3. The System Builder Angle
Framework-first approach with clear methodology, "How I turned [tool] into [system]" structure, focusing on persistent environments vs. one-off usage.

### 4. The Meta-Learning Angle
AI as thinking partner, not productivity tool, emphasizing cognitive enhancement and decision-making, focusing on "how to think" vs. "what to do."

### 5. The Behind-the-Scenes Angle
Process documentation and workflow transparency, "Here's exactly how I..." approach with technical curiosity and conversion bridge to paid tier.
