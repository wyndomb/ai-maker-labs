# Generate New Substack Notes

Based on the social notes in substack-notes/most-performing-notes.md and substack-notes/well-performing-notes.md and newsletter themes, generate 10 new social media notes that:

1. Follow the conversational, insight-driven style
2. Focus on AI workflow mastery, tool mastery, or thinking mastery
3. Use personal anecdotes and realizations
4. Challenge common AI assumptions
5. End with actionable insights
6. Use the "â€“" separator between notes
7. Keep the output around 200-300 characters
8. Make sure it hasn't written before based on my past notes and notes inside daily-notes-generation folder

Match the existing tone and save output as new dated file in substack-notes/daily-notes-generation
