Help me create a comprehensive AI Maker Lab (paid tier) implementation blueprint that provides exact step-by-step instructions.

INCLUDE:
- Complete setup instructions
- All necessary prompts and configurations
- Troubleshooting section
- Integration steps
- Optimization tips
- Advanced customization options

Ask me:
1. What system/tool are we implementing?
2. What's the end goal/outcome?
3. What's the user's starting technical level?
4. Are there specific integrations needed (MCP, Claude Projects, etc.)?

Then create the full technical implementation guide.
