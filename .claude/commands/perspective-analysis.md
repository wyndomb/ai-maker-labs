Analyze a newsletter draft through five different perspectives to uncover blind spots and strengthen the content.

When the user runs this command with a draft filename, examine the content through these five lenses:

1. **The optimist**: "What could go right?" - Identify positive outcomes and opportunities
2. **The pessimist**: "What could go wrong?" - Surface potential risks and downsides
3. **The economist**: "What are the trade-offs?" - Analyze costs, benefits, and opportunity costs
4. **The historian**: "What patterns repeat?" - Find historical precedents and cycles
5. **The contrarian**: "What if the opposite were true?" - Challenge the main thesis
