Help me update the newsletter performance statistics with new data. I'll provide:

- Post number and title
- View count
- Like count  
- Comment count
- Publication date

Please:
1. Calculate engagement rate (likes + comments / views * 100)
2. Add to performance stats table
3. Identify if this post is above/below average performance
4. Note any trending patterns
5. Suggest follow-up actions based on performance

What new performance data do you have to add?
