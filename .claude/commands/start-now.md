# Get Project Context

Read the CLAUDE.md file to understand the AI Maker Newsletter project structure, content strategy, and key guidelines.

This provides essential context about:
- Project overview and repository structure
- Content themes (AI Workflow Mastery, Tool Mastery, Thinking Mastery)
- Content development guidelines and principles
- Monetization strategy and conversion funnels
- Performance insights and quality standards

Use this command at the start of new sessions to quickly get up to speed on the project without consuming excessive context.
