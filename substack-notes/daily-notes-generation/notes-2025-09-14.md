# Daily Substack Notes - September 14, 2025

Generated social media notes following the established style and themes.

I discovered something weird about AI workflows:
The systems I built to save time now consume more time.
But it's different time—creative exploration time instead of mechanical execution time.
I'm not more productive. I'm more intellectually alive.

–

Everyone's building AI agents to do things faster.
I'm building AI systems to think deeper.
Speed without direction is just expensive wandering.
Depth with AI amplification? That's transformation.

–

My biggest AI mistake: treating it like Google search.
Ask question → get answer → move on.
Real breakthrough came when I started treating it like a thinking gym.
Same question, explored from 6 different angles.
The workout makes all the difference.

–

AI didn't replace my procrastination—it revealed what I was actually avoiding.
"I don't know where to start" became "I don't know what I want to accomplish."
The blank page was never the problem.
Unclear intention was.

–

Hot take: The people panicking about AI taking jobs are missing the real shift.
AI isn't replacing workers.
It's revealing which workers never learned to think critically.
The question isn't "Will AI replace me?"
It's "What thinking do I bring that AI can't replicate?"

–

I used to save "good ideas" for when I had time to execute them properly.
Now I throw half-formed thoughts at Claude and see what develops.
90% lead nowhere.
10% become things I never could have built alone.
Volume beats perfection when exploration is free.

–

The weirdest thing about working with AI: it made me realize how much I think in shortcuts.
"Just make it like that other thing" doesn't work with AI.
You have to articulate what "that other thing" actually does.
Teaching AI forced me to understand my own ideas.

–

AI turned me into a different type of perfectionist.
Before: "I need perfect conditions to start."
After: "I need perfect questions to explore."
The shift from execution paralysis to exploration obsession.

–

I've started rating my conversations with AI not by output quality, but by how much they changed my thinking.
Great AI sessions leave you with better questions, not just better answers.
If you're thinking the same way after a Claude conversation, you're using it wrong.

–

The most valuable AI skill isn't prompt engineering—it's pattern recognition.
Learning to spot when AI is giving you what you asked for vs. what you actually need.
Most breakthroughs happen when AI misunderstands your request in interesting ways.
