AI taught me something unexpected about learning:
I stopped trying to memorize information.
Instead, I learned to ask better questions.
Now I can explore any topic instantly without carrying the weight of facts I'll forget.
The skill isn't knowing everything—it's knowing how to think about anything.

–

Everyone's building AI workflows for productivity.
I'm building AI environments for discovery.
Productivity optimizes what you already know you want to do.
Discovery reveals what you didn't know was possible.
The magic happens in the second category.

–

I used to think AI made me lazier.
Turns out it made me more intellectually honest.
When you can explore any idea without the friction of "research time," you stop making excuses for shallow thinking.
AI doesn't let you hide behind "I don't have time to figure this out."
Now you have to admit: "I'm not curious enough to explore this."

–

The best AI habit I've developed: asking it to steelman my worst ideas.
"Take this terrible concept and make the strongest possible case for it."
Either I discover hidden value I missed, or I understand exactly why it's terrible.
Both outcomes save me from mediocre execution.

–

AI changed my relationship with perfectionism.
Before: "This needs to be perfect before I start."
Now: "This needs to be specific enough for AI to improve."
The bar shifted from perfection to clarity.
And clarity is actually achievable.

–

Most people ask AI: "What should I do?"
Better question: "What am I avoiding thinking about?"
AI becomes a mirror for your intellectual blind spots.
The resistance you feel to certain questions is exactly where the breakthrough lives.

–

I've stopped optimizing my AI prompts.
Started optimizing my thinking instead.
A clear mind with a simple prompt beats a confused mind with perfect prompt engineering.
The bottleneck isn't the interface—it's the intention behind it.

–

Weird realization: AI made me value human inconsistency more.
AI is endlessly patient and logical.
Humans are beautifully unpredictable and emotional.
Working with AI highlighted what makes human creativity irreplaceable: our gorgeous irrationality.

–

The AI users winning aren't the ones with the best tools.
They're the ones building systems that compound.
One-off AI interactions = marginal gains.
AI environments that learn your patterns = exponential returns.
Stop optimizing prompts. Start building your AI memory.

–

I trained AI to be my personal contrarian.
Every idea I'm excited about, I ask: "What would kill this?"
Every strategy I'm confident in: "Where is this most likely to fail?"
Every decision I've made: "What assumptions am I not questioning?"
The best AI isn't the one that agrees with you—it's the one that makes you think harder.
