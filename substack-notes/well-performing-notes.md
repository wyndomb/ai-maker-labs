Friends asked what got me so hooked with AI?

The answer is simple.

AI is closing the gap between my imagination and reality.

Whatever I'm imagining, AI can help me to make it into reality!

Super interesting to see therapy is most use cases of AI.

I use Claude as my CBT therapist

I use NotebookLM to read and understand me based on my 3+ years daily journal

Any interesting use cases you use with AI to understand yourself better?

"If an AI agent can do the job, don't bother hiring!" - Shopify's CEO.

This isn't just a hot takeâ€”it signals AI usage is now a baseline expectation.

Don't just dip your toesâ€”dive in.

AI isn't coming.

It's already here.

I feel like we are living in the most exciting time.

Currently, I'm vibe coding my new chrome extension app on Cursor.

While it's being coded, I asked Loveable to generate the UI for me.

While waiting for these two AI to get back to me, I posted this note.

Damn, how is this not crazy ðŸ¤¯

My vibe code workflow:

Generate PRD: Grok/4o/Claude thinking mode.

Use a Cursor to build everything.

Turn PRD to spec.md on Cursor

Ask Cursor to create step by step plan that it must follow and checklist everytime things are done

ALWAYS add file context with spec and plan MD.

Build UI using Loveable

Tell Cursor to follow Loveable design: use SS or copy paste code to Cursor from Loveable

Woila ðŸŽ‰ your app is done

Am I missing something?

A Pew Research Center revealed: While 76% of experts believe AI will benefit them personally, only 24% of the public shares this optimism.

This gap is wild!

We are still early.

I sometimes get tired of buzzwords like AI agents.

Has anyone actually seen a real AI agent that can actually help some part of your work/life?

The closest thing I've seen is Manus and n8n or lindy.ai

But n8n/lindy or zapier is automation tool combined with AI

Do we have more advanced versions than these?

--

The more frequent you use AI tools, the more you build muscle to differentiate between alpha and noise.

Remember: 90% of new AI tools will go wasted soon and only a few which will survive.

Make sure you learn the foundation so you can apply it anywhere else.

--

The first rule of building with AI is to create a rule.

The second rule of building with AI is to keep iterating the rules until you get what you want.

Simple.

I've been using a lot of no-code AI tools such as v0, Lovable, Cursor, Replit, and Bolt like crazy!

But my workflow is much simpler now:

1) Prompt to UI: Lovable just because their UI output is just so good!

2) Push the code to Github

3) Clone repo to Cursor

That's it.

You can skip bullshit from other tools and just use these two.

If you don't like Cursor, then Replit might be a better alternative!
