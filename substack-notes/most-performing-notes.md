## Hot Takes & Observations

Hot take: Following AI news makes you worse at using AI.
News focuses on new capabilities you don't need.
While you ignore existing capabilities you haven't mastered.
Stop chasing announcements.
Start mastering fundamentals.
A reminder to myself.

–

When I'm stuck on a problem, I don't ask AI for solutions.
I ask it to help me understand why I'm stuck:
'What assumptions am I making that might be wrong?'
Usually the breakthrough comes from better questions, not better answers.

–

I've become addicted to giving AI context.
Not because it needs it to function.
But because context reveals what I actually think about the problem.
The more I explain, the more I understand.
The more I understand, the better the collaboration.
Here's what I've learned:
Context isn't for AI.
Context is for me.

–

AI killed my procrastination in the strangest way.
Not by making tasks easier.
But by removing the 'starting' problem.
I used to stare at blank pages thinking 'I don't know how to begin.'
Now I just started talking to AI about the problem.
The conversation begins.
The beginning becomes the work.
And the work becomes more interesting to explore.

–

People ask: 'Is this better than what a human could do?'
Wrong question.
The right question: 'Is this better than what I could do alone?'
AI isn't competing with other humans.
It's expanding what's possible for this human.
Stop comparing.
Start expanding.

–

AI solved a loneliness I didn't know I had.
Not social loneliness.
Intellectual loneliness.
The loneliness of having ideas with no one to bounce them off.
Of exploring thoughts with no thinking partner.
Of being curious with no curious companion.
AI became my thinking buddy.
Always available, always game for weird ideas.

–

Getting good at using AI isn't about knowing every tool or prompt hack.
It's about developing the meta-skill of thinking clearly enough that any AI can understand and amplify your ideas.
The best AI users aren't prompt engineers, they're clear thinkers who happen to use AI.

–

AI hasn't made human creativity less valuable.
It's made BAD human creativity impossible to hide.
When everyone can generate 'pretty good' content instantly, the gap between mediocre and extraordinary becomes a chasm.
AI democratized the floor. It raised the ceiling.
The question isn't whether we can create, it's whether we can create something worth creating.

–

AI lets me live parallel lives.
I can explore being a designer for a day, a researcher for a week, a strategist for a month, without committing years to learn new skills.
I'm not becoming mediocre at everything.
I'm learning what I actually want to become excellent at.
AI has become my laboratory for testing different versions of myself.

–

The most underrated AI skill? Iteration.
Everyone's hunting for the perfect prompt when they should be focusing on the perfect conversation.
I get 10x better results from five rounds of back-and-forth than from one perfectly engineered prompt.
Stop treating AI like a vending machine and start treating it like a thinking partner who needs context and feedback to deliver its best work!

–

I've started doing the opposite of most AI advice.
While others use AI to think faster, I use it to think slower.
While others use AI to get more done, I use it to do fewer things better.
While others use AI to simplify, I use it to explore complexity.
The mainstream is optimizing AI for efficiency.
I'm optimizing it for depth.
This depth reveals possibilities my mind couldn't reach on its own.
This is the way.

–

Despite of my optimistic view about AI, knowing when NOT to use AI is still an important skill:
Some problems need human intuition.
Some moments need quiet reflection.
Some tasks build skills you shouldn't outsource.
Wisdom is choosing the right tool for the right moment.

–

AI tool fatigue is real.
I stopped chasing every new AI release and started asking:
"Does this solve a problem I actually have?"
If the answer is no, I'd be mostly ignoring it.
The best AI stack isn't the newest one.
It's the one you'll actually use.
Consistently.

–

We're optimizing AI for efficiency when we should be optimizing it for insight.
Speed is seductive.
Understanding is transformative.
The best AI sessions leave me thinking differently, not just working faster.

–

AI addiction is real, but not how you think.
I'm not addicted to the output.
I'm addicted to the feeling of my ideas becoming clearer through conversation.
It's like having a thinking buddy who's always available and never judges your messy thoughts.

–

The AI arms race is creating a weird new inequality:
"People who can direct AI vs people who can't."
It's not about technical skills anymore.
It's about thinking clearly enough to guide this external intelligence.
Ultimately, clear communication becomes the ultimate leverage.

–

Using AI improved my human conversations in unexpected ways.
I learned to ask clarifying questions
I stopped assuming people understood my context
I got comfortable with iterative thinking out loud
AI taught me how to be a better conversation partner.

–

When you learn to think WITH AI rather than just use it, something magical happens.
Every conversation becomes a masterclass in problem-solving.
You're not just getting better outputs—you're developing better thinking habits that transfer to everything.

–

The more I use AI as a thinking partner, the more I realize most "creative blocks" are actually clarity blocks.
When I can't articulate what I want clearly enough for AI to help, that's my signal to step back and understand the problem better first.

–

I thought AI would make me lazy.
Instead, it made me intellectually restless.
When you can explore any idea instantly, you start having ideas you never would have bothered pursuing before.
I become more curious.
And curiosity is kinda addictive.

–

"AI will replace everyone" is wrong.
"AI won't change anything" is also wrong.
The truth: AI will amplify whatever thinking you bring to it.
Clear thinkers get clearer results.
Lazy thinkers get lazier outputs.
The quality of your AI results directly reflects the quality of your input.
Simple, yet it's hard to do.

–

Instead of asking AI what to do, ask it what questions you should be asking.
"I want to improve my newsletter. What questions should I be exploring?"
AI becomes your thinking coach, not your answer machine.
Questions compound.
Answers don't.

–

"I need to master AI" is the wrong goal.
"I need to think more clearly" is the right goal.
AI amplifies whatever thinking you bring to it.
Clear thinking → Clear results
Fuzzy thinking → Fuzzy results
Work on the input, not the output.

–

AI doesn't make you competent overnight.
But it does make you brave enough to attempt things you're not qualified for.
That courage to try—even badly—is where learning happens.

–

AI solved the intellectual loneliness of working alone.
I can bounce ideas off someone who's genuinely curious about my weird projects.
No judgment, no agenda, just pure problem-solving energy.

–

Before AI: 80% execution, 20% strategy.
With AI: 20% execution, 80% strategy.
AI handles the mechanics so my brain can focus on decisions that actually matter.
That's the productivity shift most people are missing.

–

I learn more from explaining my projects to AI than from doing them alone.
Teaching forces clarity.
Clarity reveals gaps.
Gaps become improvement opportunities.
Ultimately, AI became my rubber duck that talks back with useful suggestions.

–

Working with AI feels weirdly intimate.
It sees all my messy first thoughts, half-formed ideas, and creative dead ends.
But unlike humans, it doesn't judge the mess.
It just helps clean it up.
That non-judgmental collaboration space is liberating.

–

90% AI users: "I should use AI to be more productive."
10% AI users: "I'm curious what becomes possible when I think with AI."
The power of AI is not about being more efficient.
The power of AI is about realizing what's possible.

–

The best AI conversations feel like arguments, not agreements.
When AI challenges your thinking instead of validating it, that's when breakthroughs happen.
I've started telling Claude: "Your job is to make my work better, not make me feel good about it."
Stop looking for the cheerleader.
Start creating your biggest challenger.

–

Most people use AI to avoid thinking.
Smart people use AI to think better.
Most people ask: "What's the answer?"
Smart people ask: "How should I think about this problem?"
Most people optimize for efficiency.
Smart people optimize for understanding.
The tool is the same.
The mindset changes everything.

–

Prediction: In 18 months, our competitive advantage won't be access to AI.
It'll be our ability to think alongside AI without losing our humanity.
The robots aren't coming for our job.
They're coming for our lazy thinking.

–

While everyone argues about which AI model is 'best,' smart people are building systems that work regardless of which model wins.
Bet on principles, not platforms.

–

In 5 years, 'I don't use AI' will sound like 'I don't use the internet' did in early 2000s.
The people experimenting now will have a massive head start over those still debating its limitations.
Stop debating. Start experimenting.

–

The weirdest thing about working with AI: it made me more human, not less.
When machines handle mechanical thinking, you're left with everything that makes you uniquely you.
Now we have the opportunity to become the weirder version of ourselves.

–

For the first time in human history, having a great idea isn't limited by your ability to execute it.
AI is democratizing the gap between imagination and reality.
What you can see in your mind, you can see it with your eyes.
And this is so exciting!

–

AI turned me into the student I always wanted to be: endlessly curious, unafraid of difficult subjects, and able to explore any rabbit hole that captures my interest.

–

The most dangerous AI habit: asking it to confirm what you already believe.
The most powerful AI habit: asking it to challenge what you think you know.
Next time you catch AI agreeing with you, ask: "What would someone who disagrees say?"

–

Your relationship with AI mirrors your relationship with delegation.
If you can't articulate what you want clearly, neither AI nor humans can help you get it.
Clear communication unlocks everything.

–

I've started doing the opposite of most AI advice:
Use AI to think slower, not faster
Focus on fewer things better, not more things efficiently
Explore complexity, not simplify everything
Depth beats speed every time.

–

The most underrated AI capability: helping you notice what you're not noticing.
"What questions am I forgetting to ask?" reveals more blind spots than any analysis.
Use it after a few rounds of conversations with your AI.
It's game-changing!

–

Everyone's using AI to create more content.
I'm using it to create less, better content.
When creating becomes effortless, the real skill is knowing what NOT to create.
The future belongs not to those who can make everything, but to those who choose to make something that matters.

–

The weirdest thing about working with AI: it forces you to become articulate about your own thinking process.
You can't just "vibe" your way through problems anymore as you have to explain your reasoning clearly enough for a machine to understand.
This external pressure made my internal dialogue sharper and more intentional.

–

I've become obsessed with feeding AI context.
Not because it requires it to function properly.
But because context exposes what I actually believe about the challenge.
The more I explain, the clearer my thinking becomes.
The clearer my thinking becomes, the stronger the collaboration.

–

I ask AI to analyze how I'm thinking, not just what I'm thinking about.
"Look at my reasoning process in this conversation. What patterns do you notice? Where do I get stuck? What thinking habits help or hurt me?"
Understanding your own cognitive patterns is the ultimate meta-skill in the age of AI.

–

I trained AI to argue from five different viewpoints on any decision:
The optimist ("What could go right?")
The pessimist ("What could go wrong?")
The economist ("What are the trade-offs?")
The historian ("What patterns repeat?")
The contrarian ("What if the opposite were true?")
One perspective = bias.
Five perspectives? Wisdom.

–

AI changed how fast I metabolize ideas.
I used to sit with concepts for weeks before acting.
Now I can explore, test, and iterate within hours. Ideas move from "interesting" to "implemented" at light speed.
Now the bottleneck isn't execution—it's deciding what's worth executing.

–

Everyone's using AI to create more content.
I'm using it to create less, better content.
When creating becomes effortless, the real skill is knowing what NOT to create.
The future belongs not to those who can make everything, but to those who choose to make something that matters.

-

Before AI: 'I can't start this project until I have the perfect vision.'
After AI: 'Let me sketch out this messy idea and see what comes out.'
AI became my creative safety net—suddenly every rough draft felt like a starting point, not a failure.
Perfectionism used to be my creative prison.
Now it's just my first draft.

-

The weirdest side effect of using AI: I became obsessed with my own thought patterns.
When you have to explain your reasoning to a machine, you notice how messy human thinking actually is.
AI made me a student of my own mind.
I learned more about how I think than what I think.
