Welcome to The AI Maker ðŸ§ 

You've been using AI. You know it's powerful. But Monday morning, you're still doing the same work the same way.

I've spent 2+ years figuring out how to make AI actually integrate into daily workflowsâ€”not as a novelty, but as a seamless part of how real work gets done.

## The real problem nobody's solving

What I've come to realize: the real challenge with AI is figuring out which of your actual work problems it can solve and how to weave it into your existing processes.

Most people use AI like this:

- Chat with ChatGPT occasionally
- Ask it to write an email here and there
- Use maybe 10% of what's actually possible

What you really need: Frameworks that turn AI from "cool tool I sometimes remember to use" into "integrated part of how I think and work every day."

## Why 5,200+ people read AI Maker

It's simply because I don't just test AI toolsâ€”I figure out how to actually integrate them into real work:

**Workflow integration stories**: How I transformed my content planning, research process, and decision-making (with specific steps you can copy)

**AI as thinking partner**: Moving from "ask ChatGPT questions" to "AI as thinking partner for complex projects"

**Daily integration frameworks**: Systems that make AI a natural part of your work rhythm, not an extra task

**Honest reality checks**: Which AI applications actually save time vs. which ones are just impressive demos

My rule: If I can't show you exactly how it fits into a real workflow, I don't write about it.
